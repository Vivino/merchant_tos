**VIVINO OFFERS TERMS & CONDITIONS**

Updated: 15 July 2021



1. **Prices on Vivino**

    All prices are listed in Hong Kong Dollars.  Reservations are made for any entry and update errors as well as sold-out items.  Vivino reserves the right to cancel orders if wine is out of stock

2. **Payment**

    Payment can be made through major credit cards.  When the order is completed, you will receive an order confirmation by e-mail. The confirmation is an indication that we have received your order and payment. Should there be products that we still cannot offer and you have paid online, the amount of the product will be refunded. We deduct the money for the purchase when the goods are shipped from our warehouse, but no later than 6 days after ordering.

3. **Delivery**

    We deliver exclusively to addresses in Hong Kong. Unfortunately we can not deliver to mailboxes and parcel boxes. We do not charge extra for delivery to areas such as Lantau and New Territories, but delivery may take 1-2 days longer than to other addresses.


    Delivery costs HKD100. For purchases over HKD1,500, delivery is free.


    Items are normally delivered on weekdays between 0900-1900 and sometimes on Saturdays between 0900-1300 with the company Rill Logistics. Delivery is considered to have taken place when you have received the item. If you are not at home, delivery is considered to have taken place after the delivery person has placed the item in the place designated by you. The item is delivered in this case without a receipt, and you are responsible for the item. If you cannot find an item that has been delivered without a receipt, you must contact us no later than two days after the planned delivery date, as otherwise we will not be able to obtain additional information from the delivery person about the location of the delivery.


    Orders placed on weekends are delivered after two weekdays. If the wine is to be delivered to Lantau and New Territories, you must expect a longer delivery time of 1-2 days.

4. **Return Policy**

    If you notice that you have received wrong or broken items, please notify us within 24 hours of receiving the goods either by telephone or email and we will arrange for a replacement or full refund. We offer a 14-day return policy on products.  Please reach out to our customer service team at +852 3008 3458 or hk.orders@vivino.com. Please have your order number ready at hand when contacting support.

5. **Complaints**

    If you find faults or deficiencies in a wine purchased in our online store, please contact us at hk.orders@vivino.com and describe the problem and remember to note which order number the wine comes from. In some cases, documentation of the defect may be requested so that we can refund the wine, so do not throw away the bottle, remaining contents or stopper before you have been in contact with us

6. **Order Cancellations**

    If you want to cancel an order before it is shipped, click on "Cancel order" on the order overview no later than 25 minutes after the order has been placed. You can always find the order overview by clicking on "Orders" under your profile.

7. **Representation of Legal Drinking Age**

    It is illegal to sell alcohol to people under the age of 18. It is the customers’ responsibility to ensure their logins are not misused by any person under 18 years old. It is also required for delivery to be received by a person 18 years of age or older (ID to be shown on request) – if not, the goods will be delivered on another day.


    Under the law of Hong Kong, intoxicating liquor must not be sold or supplied to a minor in the course of business.

8. **Contact**

    If you experience problems regarding a wine purchase, you can contact our support on tel. +852 3008 3458 on weekdays between 10:00-17:00 or via email at hk.orders@vivino.com. Please have your order number ready at hand when contacting support.


    Note that if you need to change or cancel an order before it is dispatched, click on "Cancel order" on the order overview no later than 25 minutes after the order has been placed.
